## OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: User data and preferences are handled through private attributes and accessed via getters/setters.
- **Abstraction**: Complex data handling and filtering logic are encapsulated within classes.
- **Inheritance**: The system follows a hierarchical structure with base and derived classes for different components.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods are overridden to handle different user input cases effectively.

## Java Concepts Used

### **Classes & Objects**
- **User Class**: Stores user details (age, gender, region, genre preference).
- **Movie Class**: Holds movie details such as title, genre, and rating.
- **RecommendationEngine Class**: Implements the recommendation logic.

### **Functions & Methods**

#### **displayGUI()**
- Initializes the **Swing-based GUI** and displays components.

```java
public void displayGUI() {
    JFrame frame = new JFrame("FilmGenie - Movie Recommendations");
    frame.setSize(500, 500);
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    frame.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
    
    JLabel title = new JLabel("Welcome to FilmGenie");
    frame.add(title, BorderLayout.NORTH);
    
    frame.setVisible(true);

            filteredMovies.add(movie);
        }
    }
    return filteredMovies;
}
```
